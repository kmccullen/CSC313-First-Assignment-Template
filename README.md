Either manually, or using copilot, generate a simple HTML webpage that does the following:

Displays Hello World!

Displays a button that changes "World" to a name that you enter.

In the html file, you need to change:
- The function name
- The function content, a prompt for a new name, and the DOM call (provided) to change the text on the level one header
- The ID on level one header (in the h1 tag AND in the function)
- The button tag, to call your function by name AND to put a label on the button

I was able to generate this in Visual Studio Code using one copilot prompt.

If you decide to go that route, add a second button and a second function changes the color of the text.

Once you start, you'll probably notice that Visual Studio Code is willing to give you that code. Make sure you understand what it does!
